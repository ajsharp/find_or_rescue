FindOrRescue
============

This is a very simple plugin that mixes a method into ActiveRecord::Base called find_or_rescue.

The find_or_rescue method calls the find method. If the model is found, then it is returned. If it is not found, then we rescue the ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound error and return false.

I've found this most useful when adding associated models, based on user input. 


Example
=======

class CartItem < ActiveRecord::Base
	belongs_to :product
	
	def add_product(product_id_from_params_hash)
		self.product_id = product_id_from_params_hash if Product.find_or_rescue(product_id_from_params_hash)
	end
end
